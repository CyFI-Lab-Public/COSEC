# COSEC

This repository accompanies our IEEE S&P 2025 paper, [*Identifying Incoherent Search Sessions: Search Click Fraud Remediation Under Real-World Constraints*](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/sp/2025/223600a093/26hiTuB0GBi). 

COSEC is a system designed to quantify the incoherence index of search sessions by integrating semantic, temporal, and ad-click behavioral features. It evaluates session coherence through a unified scoring framework. In our evaluation, COSEC achieved a precision of 95.79% and a recall of 92.40% in identifying incoherent sessions, demonstrating strong potential to improve real-world click fraud detection.

We are currently working with our collaborators to finalize the release of the open-source prototype. We appreciate your patience, and in the meantime, please refer to the paper for additional details.
